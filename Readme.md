Mern Stack Project Assignment 1

The HTML code outlines a simple webpage for a restaurant called "Meraki." The page includes a header with a logo and navigation menu, followed by sections that showcase different categories of food items. Below is a detailed explanation of each part of the code:-
Title tag is used to Set the title of the webpage.
Link tag is to add an external CSS file for styling.

Body tag contains the content of the webpage..
The logo section includes an image (logofinal.png) and a heading (Meraki) that is used to add logo with restaurant name in webpage. 

The navigation (nav) section contains links to different pages (Home, My Orders, Add to Cart, Login).On clicking on login it will direct to login page that I also made using form tag(used to take input from user) in new file called form.html that is linked by using anchor tag in index.html file.
There is also a search bar for searching food items.

Shop Sections
The shop sections are divided into two main sections (shop-section and shop-section2), each containing different food categories.
Each box (e.g., box1, box2, box3) within the shop-section includes:
A heading (e.g., Starters).
An image set as a background.
A button linking to an external website for more information.
Star ratings using Font Awesome icons.

Second Shop Section (shop-section2):
Continuation of Food Categories: Similar structure as the first shop section but with different categories like Veg Main Course, Non-Veg Main Course, and Desserts.
